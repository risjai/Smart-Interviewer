Prashant Menon,6,5,"He seems to be not in touch with Object Oriented concepts. He was hesitant to make his own class for the stack implementation. Instead he was trying to implement it using a global array and variables. Asked him to make his own class. He was initially passing the class members as params to the member functions. It was a bit difficult to recollect that the member functions can directly access the member variables. His implementation for methods like push, pop, isEmpty and isFull was fine. His coding seems to be a bit messy. The variable names used were not appropriate. For the function isEmpty he was returning true when the function is not empty", Talks less. Finds it a bit difficult to communicate his thoughts,10,6,5,0,Ambuj kumar Sharma
Rahul Kumar,7,5,"He wrote the code in java, a bit slow in writing the code and missed some corner cases like null checks and carrying forward the last carry. He fixed the issues after I pointed out these issues. I asked some test cases to test his function. He was able to come up with decent number of test scenarios. He immediately wrote almost perfect code this time. 
Overall, I found him decent in coding and PS.",He said he is working on some ML algo to classify sellers but could not clearly articulate his work.,10,6,4,1,Arshan
Prasanth Menon,8,7,"He thought about different datastructures that could be apt here, but he needed a lot of hints to come to the right solution of using a DLL. His thought process is good. He was allocating an extra space for each node, which he corrected when I pointed it out. His code was error free with corner cases handled. He was quick to write the code. Was good at asking questions and understanding the problem. He did not know how to start with the solution. Picking up hints he made a start in the right direction, of using a greedy approach. However he got stuck In between as he was not able to understand how to make matches. Had to call it off due to lack of time. ",Good,10,6,4,1,Supreeth
Rishab,7,5,He asked the right questions to begin with. He could identify how the system architecture would change and the talked about some of the implications. ,"He talked about seller recall product he worked at flipkart. He was not able to articulate well in terms of complexity of problem and the challenges involved. He said he is the sole person involved in the product. However, when I asked to talk about anything which went wrong, he couldn’t think of anything. Average.",10,6,4,1,Arshan
Shyam,4,5,"He took some time in understanding the problem and went a completely wrong way initially. Instead of processing the number by each digit, he said he'd build a map of all possible permutations of each digit and then try to construct. I asked him to think about a better approach, and eventually got him going in the correct direction. He took a few more minutes before coming with the solution. I asked him to code it, which he did. His solution would have worked, but he didn't really test it. I expect better from a 6+ year candidate. Overall I got the impression that he is good with using existing tooling and solutions, and not really aware of how they internally work. This was despite his stated desire to work on building such solutions from the basics. For PS, he was quick to try solving the problem without pausing to think whether he was solving the right problem",Doesn't talk much,10,6,6,0,Mayank Rathore
Rahul Kumar,4,7,He took a lot of time to understand the problem even after I explained clearly with examples. He proposed solutions which were not making any sense. Finally he provided a decent but not completely correct solution using BST. He was very confident that now it will work without realizing the fact that why it did not work earlier. He should have done something on this second problem at least. Overall I found him weak in PS and could not write the code for the simple problem. ,was fine,10,6,7,0,Prakash
